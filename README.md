This is a web-based todo list. It is made by **webpack**. It will use Local Storage and it won't collect any data.

Still ongoing.

### What I learned
- Using `flex` for table rows is not a good idea.
- JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11.
- This is my first time using color variables in *CSS*.
- This is my first time using `color`, `date` and `time` input types. 
- Learned that `datetime-local` is not that widely supported.
- This is also my first project that tries to use exclusively English for variable names and such to increase code readability.
- `colspan` property is only valid for elements with `display:table-row`, meaning it is incompatible with `flex`.
- This is my first time using `linear-gradient` property.
- Be aware when you are using object properties when filtering. `==` might be preferred over `===`.
